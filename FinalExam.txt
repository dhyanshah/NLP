“I took my father out for dinner to Le Bistro on New Year’s Eve. The décor and service were fantastic. We enjoyed the food, especially their French countryside specials and their Chardonnay collections. However, my father thought the menu prices were a bit on the high side. Valet parking was also expensive. Overall, we definitely recommend Le Bistro for special occasions!”Overall rating: 8 stars out of 10“
